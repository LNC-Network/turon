# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help keep turon secure. I’m a solo maintainer (GitHub: @Jit-nath) — please report vulnerabilities so I can fix them quickly and responsibly.

## Reporting

Preferred: Create a GitHub Security Advisory for this repository: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories

If you cannot use an advisory, open an issue but do NOT post exploit details publicly — mention @Jit-nath in the issue and mark the title with `SECURITY:` so it can be handled privately as soon as possible.

Do not publish exploit code or a full technical write-up before a patch is available.

## What to include

When reporting, please provide:
- A clear summary of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (minimal example if possible)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Affected versions or commits
- Any suggested fixes or workarounds
- Optional: PoC code (preferably in a private advisory)

## Encryption

If you need to send sensitive data and would like it encrypted, ask for a PGP key in the advisory or issue and I will provide one.

## Response timeline

As a solo maintainer I’ll do my best to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 7 business days
- Triage and outline a remediation plan within 14 days
- Coordinate a fix and disclosure; public disclosure will generally wait until a patch or mitigations are available

If more time is required I’ll communicate status and expected timelines.

## Supported versions

I will prioritize actively maintained branches and the most recent releases. If your report affects an unsupported or very old release I may provide guidance or a patch when feasible.

## Safe harbor

Please follow good-faith disclosure practices:
- Avoid privacy-invasive or destructive testing
- Provide enough detail to reproduce the issue
- I will not initiate legal action against good-faith researchers who follow this policy

## Credit and disclosure

Reporters who wish to be credited will be acknowledged in release notes or the repository unless they request anonymity.

## Automated security updates

If you’d like automated dependency security updates added (Dependabot), open an issue or a PR requesting it and I’ll enable/configure it.

Thank you — your responsible disclosures help make turon better for everyone.
